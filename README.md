# mffint
mffint is a bash script that uses a combination of built-in Unix commands (cd, read, find, echo, for, head, etc.) and external commands (sqlite3) to extract data from the Mozilla Firefox places file and output it to XML files.

## How it works
The script starts by changing to the home directory using the `cd` command.

The script prompts the user for the path to the places file by using the read command to read user input and store it in the `PLACES_PATH` variable.

If the user didn't enter a path (i.e. they pressed enter without typing anything), the script uses the find command to search for the places file in the default Firefox profile directory. The find command searches the `~/.mozilla/firefox` directory for a directory that has a name that contains the string `.default`. The head command is then used to select only the first directory that matches the search pattern. This should be the default Firefox profile directory. The script then appends `/places.sqlite` to the directory path to get the full path to the places file.

The script then uses the `sqlite3` command to get a list of all the tables in the database. The `.tables` command is executed as an argument to sqlite3 to get a list of all the tables in the database.

The script then uses the `echo` command to output the SQLite `.mode` command with the xml argument. This sets the output mode to XML.

The script then uses a for loop to loop over each table in the database. For each table, the script uses the `echo` command to output the SQLite `.output` command with the name of the XML file to output the table contents to. The script then uses the echo command to output a `SELECT * FROM` command with the name of the table to select all the rows from the table. These commands are piped into the sqlite3 command as a single string to execute them all at once.

The `sqlite3` command outputs the table contents to an XML file with the same name as the table. The XML files are saved in the same directory as the places file.

## Potential use cases for this script

* Backup: The script can be used to backup the bookmarks and other browsing history data stored in the Mozilla Firefox places file. By outputting the data to XML files, users can easily restore their bookmarks and browsing history in case of data loss or corruption.
*  Analysis: Researchers or analysts may use the script to extract data from the places file and analyze it for various purposes. For example, they may want to analyze the browsing history of users to identify patterns or trends.
* Integration: The script can be integrated into other scripts or programs that need to access the data stored in the Mozilla Firefox places file. By outputting the data in a standardized XML format, other programs can more easily read and process the data.
