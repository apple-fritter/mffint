## Overview

This project aims to provide a convenient way to peek into the Firefox `places.sqlite` database and export its data into XML files. The `places.sqlite` database is a critical component of Mozilla Firefox, responsible for storing browsing history, bookmarks, and other user-related information.

By extracting the data into XML format, it becomes more accessible and can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, reporting, data migration, and integration with other systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3: Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apple-fritter/muffin.tin.git
cd miffin.tin
```
## Usage

1. Make a copy of your Firefox profile's `places.sqlite` and place it in the project directory.
- Optionally, define the path in the script.
2. Execute the bash script places.sh to export the data into XML files.

```bash
./places.sh
```

> The script will create a new folder in your home directory, named places_tables_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS, where YYYYMMDDHHMMSS represents the current timestamp. The data from each table in the places.sqlite database will be exported as XML files within this folder.

## How is this Useful?
### 1. Data Analysis
The extracted XML files provide structured data that can be easily analyzed using various tools and libraries. Researchers and data analysts can gain insights into browsing patterns, popular websites, and user behavior.
### 2. Reporting
With the data available in XML format, it can be easily processed to generate customized reports, statistics, and visualizations. This can be valuable for website owners, marketers, and analysts to understand user engagement and improve their web presence.
### 3. Data Migration
XML is a common data interchange format. Extracting data from the SQLite database to XML enables smooth data migration between different systems and applications.
### 4. Integration with Other Systems
The XML format is widely supported across different programming languages and platforms. The extracted data can be easily integrated into other applications or databases for further processing and utilization.
Note

## Considerations

#### Database Locking:
If the places.sqlite database is locked by another process, you may encounter errors. Make sure Firefox is closed or not accessing the database while running the script.

#### Backup:
Always back up your original places.sqlite database before running any scripts that interact with it, to avoid data loss or corruption.
